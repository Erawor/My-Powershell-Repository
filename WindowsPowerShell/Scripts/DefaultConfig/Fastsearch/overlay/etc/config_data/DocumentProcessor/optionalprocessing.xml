    The optional feature 'personnameextraction' is emitting a crawled 
    property MESG Linguistcs personname(31) that can be used as a 
    refiner displaying person names extracted from the content.

<!--
    The OffensiveContentFilter (OCF) feature analyzes the amount of pornographic
    content in each processed document, tags the documents with an according 
    crawled property and finally drops documents that are pornographic.
  -->
  
<processor name="OffensiveContentFilter" active="no"/>

  
<!-- 
    The FFDDumper feature is mainly used for support and debugging purposes.
    If activated all procserver processes in the system start populating the
    directory %FASTSEARCH%\data\ffd on the same processing nodes with so called
    FFD files.

    The feature causes a considerable I/O load on the feeding nodes and consumes
    disk space in the mentioned folder on the same machines.

<processor name="FFDDumper" active="no"/>

  
<!--
    The following machers are based on dictionaries in the Resource Store:
    
    dictionaries/matching/wholewords_extraction{1,2,3}.xml
    dictionaries/matching/wordparts_extraction{1,2}.xml

    which can be edited by users to implement custom crawled properties
    extracted from the content. These can e.g. be used for refiners.

    The WholeWordsExtractor{1,2,3} features are optimized for matching
    words in Western languages, and the WordsPartExtractor{1,2} features
    are optimized for substring lookup which is needed e.g. for Asian
    languages.
